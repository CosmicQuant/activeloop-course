            "“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,” wrote Meta in a blog post.\n",

            "Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has introduced its AI Research SuperCluster (RSC), an AI supercomputer that is expected to be the fastest in the world once completed in mid-2022. The RSC will be capable of training models with trillions of parameters and aims to enable the development of AI systems for applications like real-time voice translations and collaborative AR gaming. Meta anticipates that the RSC will be 20 times faster than its current clusters and will significantly improve training times for large-scale NLP workflows. The supercomputer was designed with security and privacy controls to allow Meta to use real-world examples from its production systems for research purposes.\n"
